DRB Oct 2023: Low Inventory working model:

****** Viewer: 

Banner: In the above code, if notificationAlerts is > 0, there will be a banner at the top of the page. 
But the banner itself hides its contents if you are in the low inventory plan itself, as there is no point wasting space.

Audio: This plays whenever the watch on computed alertInvItems sees lowInvPingCount increase, but only when the 
low inventory count has increased from the previous moment (currentLowInvCount > previousLowInvCount).
In other words, when it gets the ping and the LI count has increased. This tries to not be too obnoxious in playing the audio.

From slack: 
DRB: why there is no LI plan here since there are warnings about them on the rows:

Felipe: Tasks can show a red triangle that they are LI. But NO low inventory plan needs to show if these are ALL within active plans (current time is between
the start and end times).

Corey: so if a product has low inventory...
if there is an active task in an active plan, then it just shows in line (in the row)
if there isn't an active task in an active plan, then it generates a LI plan
     
DEAN: What do you mean an active task?

Corey: if there is already a task in a plan that is active for the given product

****** Builder:

There is no MTO plan in builder, according to Jordan.

New logic Oct 31, 2023: 

Viewer: No checks on editing the LI plan - code removed.
Every 10 minutes, do a check.
The check does 2 things: 

1. Check for LI. If LI plan exists (which implies count > 0) and it's within the LI start-to-end time range: 
    a. Mark LI banner as visible.
    b. If NOT currently on the LI plan, play audio alert.
2. Check for MTO. If count > 0:
    a. Mark LI banner as visible.
    b. If NOT currently on the LI plan, play audio alert.
